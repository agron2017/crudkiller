# crudkiller
Just a starter crud generator.

More simple than Laravel or cake, but not as feature rich.
Designed for those that like to create the database first.

association tables - foreign keys need to be named *._id,
and table "types" need to be of the style :

table employee
table employee_type.

Form dropdown lists will be generated from the "type" tables.

default bootstrap 3 (although i want to create a metroui version)

Not ready for public use.
